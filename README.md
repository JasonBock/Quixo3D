# Quixo3D

A 3D version of the [Quixo](https://en.gigamic.com/game/quixo) board game. This was created with [Mike Hodnick](https://github.com/kindohm). The [presentation](https://twincitiescodecamp.com/events/tccc3/jason-bock-quixo-3d-game-programming-in-net) was done at the [3rd](https://twincitiescodecamp.com/events/tccc3) [Twin Cities Code Camp](https://twincitiescodecamp.com/).

Literally **no work** has been done on this since the presentation in 2007. If you want to update it such that it's targeting .NET 5, or you want to create another front-end in Blazor or MAUI, PRs will be happily accepted!
